Local random circuits scramble efficiently and accordingly have a range of applications in quantum information and quantum dynamics. 
With a global $$U(1)$$ charge however, the scrambling ability is reduced; for example, such random circuits do not generate the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. 
We establish two results using the statistical mechanics of k-fold replicated circuits. 
First, we show that finite moments cannot distinguish the ensemble that local random circuits generate from the Haar ensemble on the entire group of number-conserving unitaries. 
Specifically, the circuits form a kc-design with $$kc = O(L^d)$$ for a system in $$d$$ spatial dimensions with linear dimension L. 
Second, for $$k < kc$$, the depth $$\tau$$ to converge to a k-design scales as $$\tau \gtrsim kL^{d+2}$$. 
In contrast, without number conservation $$\tau \gtrsim kL^d$$. 
The convergence of the circuit ensemble is controlled by the low-energy properties of a frustration-free quantum statistical model which spontaneously breaks $$k$$ $$U(1)$$ symmetries. 
The associated Goldstone modes are gapless and lead to the predicted scaling of $$\tau$$.
Our variational bounds hold for arbitrary spatial and qudit dimensions; we conjecture they are tight.
